# Yard Management System

Advanced dock scheduling, trailer tracking, and yard orchestration with intelligent appointment management, gate operations, and real-time yard visibility for optimized inbound/outbound logistics.

## Overview

The Yard Management System (YMS) is a critical component of the Paklog WMS/WES platform, providing comprehensive management of yard operations, dock door scheduling, and trailer/truck tracking. In modern distribution centers, efficient yard management can reduce truck turnaround time by 30-40% and increase dock door utilization by 25%, directly impacting supply chain velocity and customer satisfaction.

This service implements sophisticated algorithms for dock door optimization, trailer positioning, gate management, and yard jockey coordination. By providing real-time visibility into yard operations and intelligent scheduling, the YMS eliminates bottlenecks at the warehouse perimeter, reduces detention fees, and improves carrier relationships.

## Domain-Driven Design

### Bounded Context

The Yard Management System bounded context is responsible for:
- Dock door scheduling and optimization
- Trailer and truck tracking within the yard
- Gate check-in/check-out operations
- Appointment management and confirmation
- Yard jockey task assignment
- Cross-dock coordination
